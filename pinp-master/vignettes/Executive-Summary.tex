Where from?

The data set which our group will be exploring highlights different
factors which contribute to an overall quality rating of the Portuguese
red wine ``Vinho Verde''. The first of the 12 variables is the fixed
acidity. The fixed acidity is a measure of the tartaric, malic, citric
and succinic, found within grapes, which are measured by a steam
distillation of a sample of the wine. The volatile acidity (being the
second variable) however measures the acetic acid levels in the wine
which impacts on the flavour of the wine negatively if the acetic acid
is too high. The third variable is citric acid which is used in wine in
order to assist in increasing flavour by in turn increasing acidity.
Moving away from acidity now, the data set analyses the residual sugars
in ``Vinho Verde''. The residual sugar in wines is not the artificially
added sugars, but the raw sugar from grapes found post fermentation,
with higher levels of residual sugar unsurprisingly resulting in sweeter
wine. Chlorides are used in this data set as a factor contributing
towards an overall rating for the wine due to its impact on the
saltiness of the final product. The density of wine is deemed to be a
major contributor to the overall quality of wine, with higher density
resulting in higher quality (need to elaborate on why?). pH is simply
used in wine making in order to ``determine ripeness in relation to
acidity''. Lower pH is far more desirable as it reduces susceptibility
to bacteria growth, while also increasing the quality of taste by making
the final product ``tart and crisp''. Sulphate levels are the next
criteria the researchers used to determine overall wine quality
rankings, with the sulphate being used in wine in order to protect the
final product from bacteria. Evidently, alcohol concentration is a major
contributing factor towards the final quality of ``Vinho Verde'', with
it having a large impact on flavour and desirability for the intended
market. Finally, the final quality ranking summarises all of the
previous factors into a final value.
