\acknow{We gratefully acknowledge all the help from the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=rticles}{rticles} package
\citep{CRAN:rticles} which not only introduced us to the powerful
\href{http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/latex.xhtml}{PNAS LaTeX} style
class, but also provided useful code templates to study in the other
mode as the fine macros. The \href{http://pandoc.org}{pandoc} document
converter \citep{pandoc} is the much-admired driving force behind the
document manipulation.}
